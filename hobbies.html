  <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/godalminggaming">Gaming (Both board gaming and computer gaming)</a></li>
        <p>I am a huge fan of board games and RPG's, especially those of a fantasy nature. I regularly participate in a couple of DnD campaigns as a player and often host board game nights for friends. We also regularly play online Multiplayer games, with a favourite genre being survival. With a firm favourite being Miscreated. </p>
      <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/sotsgodalming">HEMA (Historal European Martial Arts)</a></li>
        <p>I have been attending the School of the Sword in Godalming for over 4 years. We study early Italian sidesword and buckler and both single rapier and rapier and dagger. I have over the last couple of years taken part in several national and international competitions</p>
      <li><a href="https://purpleport.com/portfolio/leighr76/?referrer=leighr76">Photography</a></li>
        <p>I have always enjoyed the creative side of photography and have undertaken several studio days and shoots for friends, including weddings</p>
      <li>Drawing</li>
        <p>I have always had a keen interest in drawing and art. I'm currently undertaking a character drawing course which I am using to help with character design for some of the games we play</p>
      <li>Cooking</li>
        <p>I enjoy all forms of cooking, experimenting with new flavours and techniques. As a family we have quite significant portion of our meals as vegan and I have recently been expanding my knowledge of that field</p>
